Challenge II: Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) Tata Capital
About the business: A large-scale Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) with a presence across
India oﬀers personal loans, home loans, auto loans and more. To increase revenue from exis8ng
customers, the NBFC aims to sell personal loans to prosects and its exis8ng customers through a
web-based chatbot interface.
The chatbot will serve as a digital sales assistant, where a Master Agent (Agen)c AI
Controller) coordinates mul8ple Worker AI agents to handle the end-to-end loan sales process —
from conversa8on and verifica8on to credit evalua8on, and approval and genera8ng a sanc8on
le_er.
Problem statement: The NBFC wants to improve its sales success rate for personal loans by using an
AI-driven conversa8onal approach. The solu8on must simulate a human-like sales process, where
the Master Agent handles customer conversa8ons, engages customers in a personalized manner and
collaborates with mul8ple Worker AI agents to complete the loan process.
Goal: Teams must design an Agen)c AI solu)on where the Master Agent:
1. 2. 3. Chats with customers landing on the web chatbot via digital ads or marke8ng emails
Understands the customer's needs and convinces them to take a personal loan
Orchestrates mul8ple Worker AI agents to complete all tasks—verifica8on, underwri8ng and
sanc8on le_er genera8on—before closing the chat.
Key deliverable: A 5-slides PPT showcasing the end-to-end journey from the ini8al chat to sanc8on
le_er genera8on.
